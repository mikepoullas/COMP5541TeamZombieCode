# Code Review

The following checklist should be used during code reviews:

- [ ] Code accomplishes its functional purpose.
- [ ] Code passes automated testing (none at the moment)
- [ ] Code passes linting (in progress).
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable.
  - [ ] functions are introduced with accompanying documentations.
  - [ ] functions and variables are introduced with properly describing names. 
- [ ] Code reuses existing code when possible.
